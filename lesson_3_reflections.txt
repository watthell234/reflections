When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I'd like to share my project with other developers in the world and when I want to collaborate with friends on a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because auto syncing prohibits testing out new features because your code would be automatically updated with cloud code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are easy ways for repositories to be cloned in the cloud. Clones take code base and replicates it on to someone else's local hard drive. Branches are partitions to code bases where contributors can isolate changes to code base before contributing change.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

That it allows project collaborators to have redundancies in case, merge conflicts lead to major bugs.
