When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I'd like to share my project with other developers in the world and when I want to collaborate with friends on a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because auto syncing prohibits testing out new features because your code would be automatically updated with cloud code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are easy ways for repositories to be cloned in the cloud. Clones take code base and replicates it on to someone else's local hard drive. Branches are partitions to code bases where contributors can isolate changes to code base before contributing change.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

That it allows project collaborators to have redundancies in case, merge conflicts lead to major bugs.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I would have to share files back and forth between the people that are collaborating. Pretty much everything would be more difficult, tracking changes, comparing those changes to previous versions, fixing conflicts between merges.
Cannot seem to find a single benefit of sharing local files back and forth besides can set rules to only collaborate one at a time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

I think that the time in which you want to make changes in a branch instead of master when a developer is testing completely new features and when there are multiple people working on a project. Haing a personal branch for a big project.
